The Big O notatoin for each file:

a) Task0: O(1)
The script returns the first and last record of any input given, so the Big O is 1.
____________________
b) Task1: O(n)
The script iterate over the input and add every record to a set, so it runs as much as the file's length.
____________________
c) Task2: O(n)
This one is like Task1, it filters the input so it pass on every record and iterate over them to add the time to the dict.
____________________
d) Task3: O(nlog(n))
Here we are using sorted function, sorted splits the input into two halfs and splits one half again until sorting all the values, so it is a nlog() notation 
____________________
e) Task4: O(nlog(n))
Task4 is similar to Task3, it uses sorted function.
