The Big O notatoin for each file:

a) Task0: O(1)
The script returns the first and last record of any input given, 
so the Big O is 1.
____________________
b) Task1: O(n)
The script iterate over the input and add every record to a set, 
so it runs as much as the file's length.
____________________
c) Task2: O(n)
This one is like Task1, it filters the input so it pass on every record, 
and iterate over them to add the time to the dict.
____________________
d) Task3: O(nlog(n))
Here we are using sorted function besides iterate over the all values in the input by a for loop, 
sorted splits the input into two halfs and splits one half again until sorting all the values, so it is a nlog(n) notation
it should be O(nlog(n)+2n) but by approximation we can say O(nlog(n))
____________________
e) Task4: O(nlog(n))
Task4 is similar to Task3, it uses sorted function and a for loop and iterate over all the values.
